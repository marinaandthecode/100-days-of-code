# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 26, 2020 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my notes app. Fixed CSS. Got stuck (again) on choosing a better way to save note content: contenteditable vs textarea input. Read some articles.
**Thoughts**: Trying to remember the app logic after a while is not easy, but I managed to. Trying not to be hard on myself as I am a newbie in React. Feel like I got better at CSS (hooray!). Want to feel the same way about writing advanced JS code.

### Day 2: May 27, 2020 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**: Played with localStorage a bit. Added create, update, delete functionality to my notes app. Struggled with a bug (setState with onChange event) and have fixed it! Other functions remain for tomorrow Exploding head 

**Thoughts** It's a great feeling to get back on track. Even when I was doing smth unrelated to coding, my mind continued processing props and functions on the background. Programming is very enjoyable when "yay, it works!"

### Day 3: May 28, 2020 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: Tried to build a (Momentum-like) dynamic page with updating clock and editable text elements from a tutorial using Vanilla JS. 
Learned about the difference between innerText and textContent. 
Need to practice DOM manipulation more, forgot some basic things ðŸ˜€

**Thoughts**: Felt less motivated today. I have to compensate motivation with discipline and to write code every day no matter what. 


### Day 4: May 29, 2020 (Friday)

**Today's Progress**: Not very productive days, but managed to learn smth. Read a large article about hooks (I haven't understand some of them yet Disappointed face).


### Day 5: May 30, 2020 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress**: Watched Yandex lecture on React.
Thought over my app structure, have an idea how to apply useEffect to Note component.

**Thoughts**: Hard to concentrate. Also don't know how to behave on Twitter during BLM situation.

### Day 6: May 31, 2020 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: Spent much time on bugs. Fixed notes state, passing props for default notes, adding new empty stickers. 
Some things get solved not as quickly as I want, but I don't stop. 
Still need to fix removing the last item instead of the one I click on. 

**Thoughts**: The whole day I thought: maybe I just need to return to work in business/finance? maybe I would not bring any value as a programmer?.. But then some code started working and programming felt like fun.
