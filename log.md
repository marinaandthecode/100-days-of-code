# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 26, 2020 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my notes app. Fixed CSS. Got stuck (again) on choosing a better way to save note content: contenteditable vs textarea input. Read some articles.
**Thoughts**: Trying to remember the app logic after a while is not easy, but I managed to. Trying not to be hard on myself as I am a newbie in React. Feel like I got better at CSS (hooray!). Want to feel the same way about writing advanced JS code.

### Day 2: May 27, 2020 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**: Played with localStorage a bit. Added create, update, delete functionality to my notes app. Struggled with a bug (setState with onChange event) and have fixed it! Other functions remain for tomorrow Exploding head 

**Thoughts** It's a great feeling to get back on track. Even when I was doing smth unrelated to coding, my mind continued processing props and functions on the background. Programming is very enjoyable when "yay, it works!"

### Day 3: May 28, 2020 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: Tried to build a (Momentum-like) dynamic page with updating clock and editable text elements from a tutorial using Vanilla JS. 
Learned about the difference between innerText and textContent. 
Need to practice DOM manipulation more, forgot some basic things ðŸ˜€

**Thoughts** Felt less motivated today. I have to compensate motivation with discipline and to write code every day no matter what.
