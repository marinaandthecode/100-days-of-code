# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 26, 2020 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my notes app. Fixed CSS. Got stuck (again) on choosing a better way to save note content: contenteditable vs textarea input. Read some articles.
**Thoughts**: Trying to remember the app logic after a while is not easy, but I managed to. Trying not to be hard on myself as I am a newbie in React. Feel like I got better at CSS (hooray!). Want to feel the same way about writing advanced JS code.

### Day 2: May 27, 2020 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**: Played with localStorage a bit. Added create, update, delete functionality to my notes app. Struggled with a bug (setState with onChange event) and have fixed it! Other functions remain for tomorrow Exploding head 

**Thoughts** It's a great feeling to get back on track. Even when I was doing smth unrelated to coding, my mind continued processing props and functions on the background. Programming is very enjoyable when "yay, it works!"

### Day 3: May 28, 2020 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: Tried to build a (Momentum-like) dynamic page with updating clock and editable text elements from a tutorial using Vanilla JS. 
Learned about the difference between innerText and textContent. 
Need to practice DOM manipulation more, forgot some basic things ðŸ˜€

**Thoughts**: Felt less motivated today. I have to compensate motivation with discipline and to write code every day no matter what. 


### Day 4: May 29, 2020 (Friday)

**Today's Progress**: Not very productive days, but managed to learn smth. Read a large article about hooks (I haven't understand some of them yet Disappointed face).


### Day 5: May 30, 2020 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress**: Watched Yandex lecture on React.
Thought over my app structure, have an idea how to apply useEffect to Note component.

**Thoughts**: Hard to concentrate. Also don't know how to behave on Twitter during BLM situation.

### Day 6: May 31, 2020 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: Spent much time on bugs. Fixed notes state, passing props for default notes, adding new empty stickers. 
Some things get solved not as quickly as I want, but I don't stop. 
Still need to fix removing the last item instead of the one I click on. 

**Thoughts**: The whole day I thought: maybe I just need to return to work in business/finance? maybe I would not bring any value as a programmer?.. But then some code started working and programming felt like fun.

### Day 7: June 1, 2020 (Monday)

**Today's Progress**: Not much progress. Just googled some articles on color-picker and drag-n-drop. So let's count this day as a pass and add 1 to the challenge.

**Thoughts**: Self-doubt. Also don't know how to behave on Twitter because of BLM :'(


### Day 8: June 2, 2020 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to use SCSS, BEM and Gulp thanks to a cool russian guy from IBM. 

**Thoughts**: I'm good at HTML/CSS, I should have started taking freelance clients earlier and earn money for my skills. 


### Day 9: June 3, 2020 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**: Played with Gulp and Sass, created a project. I'm happy to add new instruments to my skills and to have a boilerplate to reuse in new projects. Read about V8. 

**Thoughts**: I love teachers that inspire and make me believe I CAN do it. I just need to practice and put effort into it. 


### Day 10: June 4, 2020 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed delete function for notes! Struggled with it. Changed unique key from index to really unique value: date created :) 

**Thoughts**: Today I admitted that I want to go to the office and I need people. To be in touch with reality.

### Day 11: June 5, 2020 (Friday)

**Today's Progress**: Added Color Picker functionality to my app. Created BackgroundPicker component with effect of changing bgr. Also tried to make note content state available in the parent App, but failed. Read React docs.

**Thoughts**: Catched the flow today! Getting used to programming :)

### Day 12: June 6, 2020 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress**: Watched React crash course by Brad Traversy. Learned some more tricks for my apps: storing styles in Component file, use of PropTypes and uuid. Also understood (hope so) where to save state: things shared between components should be stored in the higher one. 


### Day 13: June 9, 2020 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: Learned about React Router, Links (instead of a) and how to send requests to APIs using axios. 


### Day 14: June 11, 2020 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: Decided to complete RESTful API with HTTP and JavaScript project, as Coursera offers free certificates. Now I can confidently work with APIs, handle bad data and sanitize inputs. A nice addition to my LinkedIn profile! 

**Thoughts**: I still procrastinate writing my own code from scratch.

### Day 15: June 12, 2020 (Friday)

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Drag'n'Drop, what attribute and functions I need to apply to draggable element and drop zone. Practiced on CodePen. 

**Thoughts**: I still procrastinate writing my own code from scratch.

### Day 16: June 13, 2020 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress**: Spent >3hrs trying to figure out how to save edits of individual note content to parent state. Broke my app again. Meh.

**Thoughts**: It's very frustrating not to be able to share beautiful results. 
I thought I would deploy my app last week (lol), is that what all beginners think? 


### Day 17: June 15, 2020 (Monday)

**Today's Progress**: Today I refactored previous code, separated ColorPicker component and tried to make it appear only on right click - created a custom context menu. Doesn't work as expected yet Grinning face something went wrong with positioning. 

**Thoughts**: Projects are the best way to understand your abilities and knowledge gaps. I wish I started earlier. "The time will pass anyway"

### Day 18: June 17, 2020 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**: I read React docs on state and tried to understand once again how lift it up. Doesn't go easy for me. 
Also I read an awesome article on z-index and played with interactive tool, it was one of the trickiest thing for me from the beginning. 

**Thoughts**: Guilty for not producing any value yet. 


### Day 19: June 18, 2020 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: I quickly fixed position of ColorPicker in Mynote! From page to offset. Now I understand the practical difference. Also made the component hide after choosing a color. Proud of myself for quick dive into code. 

**Thoughts**: Recent weeks my mind is trying to convince me to give up programming in favor of business functions. And I remembered my dream of working in a corporation.
