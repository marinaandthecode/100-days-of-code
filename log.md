# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 26, 2020 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my notes app. Fixed CSS. Got stuck (again) on choosing a better way to save note content: contenteditable vs textarea input. Read some articles.
**Thoughts**: Trying to remember the app logic after a while is not easy, but I managed to. Trying not to be hard on myself as I am a newbie in React. Feel like I got better at CSS (hooray!). Want to feel the same way about writing advanced JS code.

### Day 2: May 27, 2020 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**: Played with localStorage a bit. Added create, update, delete functionality to my notes app. Struggled with a bug (setState with onChange event) and have fixed it! Other functions remain for tomorrow Exploding head 

**Thoughts** It's a great feeling to get back on track. Even when I was doing smth unrelated to coding, my mind continued processing props and functions on the background. Programming is very enjoyable when "yay, it works!"

### Day 3: May 28, 2020 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: Tried to build a (Momentum-like) dynamic page with updating clock and editable text elements from a tutorial using Vanilla JS. 
Learned about the difference between innerText and textContent. 
Need to practice DOM manipulation more, forgot some basic things ðŸ˜€

**Thoughts**: Felt less motivated today. I have to compensate motivation with discipline and to write code every day no matter what. 


### Day 4: May 29, 2020 (Friday)

**Today's Progress**: Not very productive days, but managed to learn smth. Read a large article about hooks (I haven't understand some of them yet Disappointed face).


### Day 5: May 30, 2020 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress**: Watched Yandex lecture on React.
Thought over my app structure, have an idea how to apply useEffect to Note component.

**Thoughts**: Hard to concentrate. Also don't know how to behave on Twitter during BLM situation.

### Day 6: May 31, 2020 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: Spent much time on bugs. Fixed notes state, passing props for default notes, adding new empty stickers. 
Some things get solved not as quickly as I want, but I don't stop. 
Still need to fix removing the last item instead of the one I click on. 

**Thoughts**: The whole day I thought: maybe I just need to return to work in business/finance? maybe I would not bring any value as a programmer?.. But then some code started working and programming felt like fun.

### Day 7: June 1, 2020 (Monday)

**Today's Progress**: Not much progress. Just googled some articles on color-picker and drag-n-drop. So let's count this day as a pass and add 1 to the challenge.

**Thoughts**: Self-doubt. Also don't know how to behave on Twitter because of BLM :'(


### Day 8: June 2, 2020 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to use SCSS, BEM and Gulp thanks to a cool russian guy from IBM. 

**Thoughts**: I'm good at HTML/CSS, I should have started taking freelance clients earlier and earn money for my skills. 


### Day 9: June 3, 2020 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**: Played with Gulp and Sass, created a project. I'm happy to add new instruments to my skills and to have a boilerplate to reuse in new projects. Read about V8. 

**Thoughts**: I love teachers that inspire and make me believe I CAN do it. I just need to practice and put effort into it. 


### Day 10: June 4, 2020 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed delete function for notes! Struggled with it. Changed unique key from index to really unique value: date created :) 

**Thoughts**: Today I admitted that I want to go to the office and I need people. To be in touch with reality.

### Day 12: June 6, 2020 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress**: Watched React crash course by Brad Traversy. Learned some more tricks for my apps: storing styles in Component file, use of PropTypes and uuid. Also understood (hope so) where to save state: things shared between components should be stored in the higher one. 


### Day 13: June 9, 2020 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: Learned about React Router, Links (instead of a) and how to send requests to APIs using axios. 


### Day 14: June 11, 2020 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: Decided to complete RESTful API with HTTP and JavaScript project, as Coursera offers free certificates. Now I can confidently work with APIs, handle bad data and sanitize inputs. A nice addition to my LinkedIn profile! 

**Thoughts**: I still procrastinate writing my own code from scratch.

### Day 15: June 12, 2020 (Friday)

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Drag'n'Drop, what attribute and functions I need to apply to draggable element and drop zone. Practiced on CodePen. 

**Thoughts**: I still procrastinate writing my own code from scratch.

### Day 16: June 13, 2020 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress**: Spent >3hrs trying to figure out how to save edits of individual note content to parent state. Broke my app again. Meh.

**Thoughts**: It's very frustrating not to be able to share beautiful results. 
I thought I would deploy my app last week (lol), is that what all beginners think? 


### Day 17: June 15, 2020 (Monday)

**Today's Progress**: Today I refactored previous code, separated ColorPicker component and tried to make it appear only on right click - created a custom context menu. Doesn't work as expected yet Grinning face something went wrong with positioning. 

**Thoughts**: Projects are the best way to understand your abilities and knowledge gaps. I wish I started earlier. "The time will pass anyway"

### Day 18: June 17, 2020 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**: I read React docs on state and tried to understand once again how lift it up. Doesn't go easy for me. 
Also I read an awesome article on z-index and played with interactive tool, it was one of the trickiest thing for me from the beginning. 

**Thoughts**: Guilty for not producing any value yet. 


### Day 19: June 18, 2020 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: I quickly fixed position of ColorPicker in Mynote! From page to offset. Now I understand the practical difference. Also made the component hide after choosing a color. Proud of myself for quick dive into code. 

**Thoughts**: Recent weeks my mind is trying to convince me to give up programming in favor of business functions. And I remembered my dream of working in a corporation.

### Day 20: June 22, 2020 (Monday)

**Today's Progress**: Struggled to customize select for BackgroundPicker. Just applying "Background-image" to options doesn't work. Found out that styling inputs is a real problem. Read an article.

**Thoughts**: Decided to take easier web apps to practice - as it's clear I have many gaps and cannot produce results quickly enough. This "hour of code" is spent in reading and trying to understand something. It's frustrating. 


### Day 21: June 24, 2020 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**: Found a solution to dropdown background - wrap up in a div of certain width, set image as the div bgr (select needs to be less width)


### Day 22: June 25, 2020 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: Started React.js course on Codecademy! Want to consolidate my knowledge.


### Day 23: June 26, 2020 (Friday)

**Today's Progress**: Spent 2 hours on React.js course


### Day 24: June 28, 2020 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: Have learned about component classes and component instances. 
I have learned about React.Component, and about the instructions that I must provide to a component class. How to use this. 
Understood how props.children and defaultProps work! And trained them in challenges


### Day 25: June 29, 2020 (Monday)

**Today's Progress**: I built authorization form and Random Color Picker and finished React.js I course! 
Understood what this refers to in class Components. Found out that this.setState automatically calls render method. 
Started the second part, learned the idea behind the difference between component classes.


### Day 26: June 30, 2020 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: Learned another React programming pattern - CHILD COMPONENTS UPDATE THEIR SIBLINGS' PROPS
One Sibling to Display, Another to Change. Understood why I had bugs in my app - i need to divide responsibilities. 
Learned another programming pattern: dividing components into presentational components and container components.
Finished Part II and practiced PropTypes and component lifecycle methods!


### Day 27: July 1, 2020 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**: Went through Learn Asyncronous JavaScript course with codecademy. Such a complex topic 
Learned about separation of concepts principle.


### Day 28: July 2, 2020 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: Finished Asynchronous JavaScript course. Learned how to use Promise.all([]). It took longer for me to understand async-await. Now I know that it always returns a promise. Practiced error handling. 


### Day 29: July 6, 2020 (Monday)

**Today's Progress**: Learned more tricks from Vitaly. For example, setting 20px padding to section-outer and max-width to section-inner = just 2 lines to make your layout responsive for almost all screen sizes. For mobile just add a few more settings. 

**Thoughts**: Felt overwhelmed the previous days and didnâ€™t want to code. I guess itâ€™s just natural for me to have these highs and lows and take rest from programming for some days.


### Day 30: July 8, 2020 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**: Returned to freeCodeCamp certification! Solved some React challenges

**Thoughts**: React syntax is becoming â€˜automaticâ€™ to me.


### Day 31: July 9, 2020 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: freeCodeCamp React challenges again. 

**Thoughts**: Seems like I procractinate...


### Day 32: July 11, 2020 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress**: Continued with fCC. 
Also took a look at LeetCode Interview Questions Set. Scary, but definitely doable.


### Day 33: July 12, 2020 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: Tried to test my knowledge of design patterns at https://designpatternsgame.com/. The result was 48% - I never learned this topic before, knowing itâ€™s not for beginners, and I am interested in learning more now! 


### Day 34: July 15, 2020 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**: Explored Frontend Mentor projectsâ€¦


### Day 35: July 31, 2020 (Friday)

**Today's Progress**: Completed React&Redux course on SoloLearn. Now I know what Redux is made for, wtf are actions and reducers. 

**Thoughts**: I love frontend programming. Mindblowing but a nice career with beautiful results.
