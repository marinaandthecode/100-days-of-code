# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 26, 2020 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my notes app. Fixed CSS. Got stuck (again) on choosing a better way to save note content: contenteditable vs textarea input. Read some articles.
**Thoughts**: Trying to remember the app logic after a while is not easy, but I managed to. Trying not to be hard on myself as I am a newbie in React. Feel like I got better at CSS (hooray!). Want to feel the same way about writing advanced JS code.

### Day 2: May 27, 2020 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**: Played with localStorage a bit. Added create, update, delete functionality to my notes app. Struggled with a bug (setState with onChange event) and have fixed it! Other functions remain for tomorrow Exploding head 

**Thoughts** It's a great feeling to get back on track. Even when I was doing smth unrelated to coding, my mind continued processing props and functions on the background. Programming is very enjoyable when "yay, it works!"

### Day 3: May 28, 2020 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: Tried to build a (Momentum-like) dynamic page with updating clock and editable text elements from a tutorial using Vanilla JS. 
Learned about the difference between innerText and textContent. 
Need to practice DOM manipulation more, forgot some basic things ðŸ˜€

**Thoughts**: Felt less motivated today. I have to compensate motivation with discipline and to write code every day no matter what. 


### Day 4: May 29, 2020 (Friday)

**Today's Progress**: Not very productive days, but managed to learn smth. Read a large article about hooks (I haven't understand some of them yet Disappointed face).


### Day 5: May 30, 2020 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress**: Watched Yandex lecture on React.
Thought over my app structure, have an idea how to apply useEffect to Note component.

**Thoughts**: Hard to concentrate. Also don't know how to behave on Twitter during BLM situation.

### Day 6: May 31, 2020 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: Spent much time on bugs. Fixed notes state, passing props for default notes, adding new empty stickers. 
Some things get solved not as quickly as I want, but I don't stop. 
Still need to fix removing the last item instead of the one I click on. 

**Thoughts**: The whole day I thought: maybe I just need to return to work in business/finance? maybe I would not bring any value as a programmer?.. But then some code started working and programming felt like fun.

### Day 7: June 1, 2020 (Monday)

**Today's Progress**: Not much progress. Just googled some articles on color-picker and drag-n-drop. So let's count this day as a pass and add 1 to the challenge.

**Thoughts**: Self-doubt. Also don't know how to behave on Twitter because of BLM :'(


### Day 8: June 2, 2020 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to use SCSS, BEM and Gulp thanks to a cool russian guy from IBM. 

**Thoughts**: I'm good at HTML/CSS, I should have started taking freelance clients earlier and earn money for my skills. 


### Day 9: June 3, 2020 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**: Played with Gulp and Sass, created a project. I'm happy to add new instruments to my skills and to have a boilerplate to reuse in new projects. Read about V8. 

**Thoughts**: I love teachers that inspire and make me believe I CAN do it. I just need to practice and put effort into it. 


### Day 10: June 4, 2020 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed delete function for notes! Struggled with it. Changed unique key from index to really unique value: date created :) 

**Thoughts**: Today I admitted that I want to go to the office and I need people. To be in touch with reality.
