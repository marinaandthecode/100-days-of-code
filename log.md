# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 26, 2020 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my notes app. Fixed CSS. Got stuck (again) on choosing a better way to save note content: contenteditable vs textarea input. Read some articles.
**Thoughts**: Trying to remember the app logic after a while is not easy, but I managed to. Trying not to be hard on myself as I am a newbie in React. Feel like I got better at CSS (hooray!). Want to feel the same way about writing advanced JS code.

### Day 2: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
